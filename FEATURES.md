## Use Cases

### 1. Catch LLM Regressions in CI Before They Reach Production

**Problem:** Your team ships a prompt change that silently degrades answer quality by 15%. Users notice before you do.

**Solution:** `evalai init` scaffolds a regression gate in your CI pipeline. Every PR runs your evaluation suite and blocks merges when quality drops below the baseline.

**Example:** See `examples/ci-regression-gate/`

### 2. Monitor Multi-Agent Workflow Costs and Decisions

**Problem:** Your multi-agent system's costs are climbing but you don't know which agent or which decisions are responsible.

**Solution:** Instrument with `WorkflowTracer` to capture every agent handoff, tool call, and LLM invocation with cost tracking. The trace viewer shows the full decision DAG.

**Example:** See `examples/agent-tool-use/`

### 3. Run Human-in-the-Loop Annotation Campaigns

**Problem:** You need domain experts to evaluate LLM outputs for a healthcare application, but lack tooling for structured annotation.

**Solution:** Create annotation tasks with configurable rubrics. Assign to team members with role-based access. Track inter-annotator agreement and aggregate scores.
